# Solutions to Project Euler Problems

This repository contains my solutions to various [Project
Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) problems. Most (all?) of the solutions are
provided in Python, but here and there I may tinker with other languages.

Feel free to reuse, refactor, improve, and/or comment on my solutions.
